## Welcome to the test data folder 

In this folder, we have provided some test files for you to quickly get familiar with PanGraphViewer

Here are some brief descriptions for the folders

* 1-rGFA contains a DNA sequence segment from chr02 of human genome. It was constructed using hg19, hg38 and the T2T assemblies with [minigraph](https://github.com/lh3/minigraph).
* 2-GFA1 contains a GFA_v1 file adopted from [VG](https://github.com/vgteam/vg)
